# GAME DEV CLUB RECRUITMENT

Created a 2D game: **Flappy Bird** clone

The videos I referred:
* [Flappy Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihvBiJ1oC9U&t=686s)
* [Creating a Main Menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8ac_qUXQY&t=583s)
* [Creating a SpriteSheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou8VkQB2sos&t=439s)

I created some Custom Assests using [PixilArt](https://www.pixilart.com/)
